        <h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Shawn Rich, a dedicated stay-at-home dad. I married my wonderful wife on March 1, 2012, when I was 23 years old. Together, we have two amazing sons who fill our lives with pride and joy.
			<br>
			Currently, I'm in a transitional phase, seizing the opportunity to embark on a career in the Tech Industry. To build a solid foundation, I've been pursuing various courses through Coursera, including the Google IT Support Professional Certification and the Web Design for Everyone Certification. Through these courses, I’m learning the fundamentals of IT support and web design.
			<br>
			My aspirations don’t stop there. I'm also eager to delve into programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and C++. 
			<br>
			Below is a list of certifications I've achieved so far, reflecting my dedication to continuous learning and professional growth.
